Queston 1
Did you feel that the proposal you graded was complete in terms of length, and that it demonstrated a genuine effort on your peer's part. If not, explain what you felt was lacking.
A: I think the proposal I reviewed was partially complete in terms of length, because the research plan part was relatively weak and short. However, I can tell my peer put a lot of efforts into this proposal.
Question 2
Briefly summarize the overarching objective and hypothesis of the reviewed proposal.
A: The extent of damage or magnitude of change in coral diversity over time can be assessed and compared between edge and center of the Great Barrier Reef in terms of temperature changes. The author did not provide a hypothesis.
Question 3
Does the hypothesis meet the following criteria in your estimation? If not, explain why.
	•	Do you believe that this hypothesis is coherent and understandable?
	•	Do you believe that this hypothesis is novel?
	•	Do you believe that this hypothesis is testable/feasible?
	•	Do you believe that this hypothesis is scientifically or socially relevant?

A: The hypothesis was not provided.

Question 4
Summarize the areas where you felt that the proposal could be improved.
A: I feel like the research plan part could be improved. The author should give a more comprehensive description of what she is going to do in her actual research.
Question 5
What constructive criticism did you provide to your peer to address the areas that needed improvement?
A: The author needs to provide a hypothesis at the end of the introduction section; Also, research plan needs to be more comprehensive, for example, the author can talk about how she is going to collect the data and how to analyze them.
Question 6
Did you feel that this proposal made an adequate use of citation and background research? If not, what additional information did you want to see?
A: The paper did not use adequate amount of citations. The background research is pretty solid. The author should use more citations in the justification section in order to make the paper more persuasive.
Part II

Question 2

A: The reviewer felt that my proposed project is scientifically and socially relevant. 
Question 3
Did the reviewer approve of your proposed analytical methods? If not, how will you improve them?
A: My peer reviewer thought that my method part is weak. In order to improve it, I should include more details in my methods and give a comprehensive explanation of what I am going to do. 
Question 4
Do you feel that your reviewer did an adequate and thorough job in their review? How could they have improved their review?
A: I think my reviewer did an thorough job in reviewing my proposal. One thing that I think my peer reviewer can improve on is that maybe she could provide more details in how I should fix my method section.
Question 5
In general, what steps will you now take to improve your proposal?
Firstly, I will start reviewing my topic and maybe change it a little bit and find a way to talk about background information more explicitly. Then, since the method part is going to require a lot of work for me to fix it, I will consult with Andrew in order to get a better understanding on how to write the method part scientifically.
